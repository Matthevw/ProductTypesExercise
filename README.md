# ProductTypesExercise
By doing this exercise I learned how to create and save product programmatically using Model and Resource Model.
I also learned how to check if a product exists using Collection and filtering by wanted value.
In addition this exercise connects to the Logger module and saves error in log file if the product you are looking for isn't in the Collection.
